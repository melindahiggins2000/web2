Data and code are published electronically on the journal’s website as Supplementary Materials.\n\n- Victoria Stodden's definitions of [types of reproducibility](http://ropensci.github.io/reproducibility-guide/sections/introduction/)\n\n## Dynamic Documentation\n\n- [\"Literate Programming\"](http://www.literateprogramming.com/) coined by Donald Knuth in 1984.\n\n> \"Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.\"\n\n- A document that is _\"dynamic\"_ is created using current data + code + text\n- This presentation is an **`R Markdown`** presentation. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.\n- This presentation is \"dynamic\" and was created by clicking the **Knit** button.\n- The terms most often used are **`sweave`** and **`knit`** [Sweave by Friedrich Leisch](https://www.statistik.lmu.de/~leisch/Sweave/) and [`knitr` by Yihui Xie](http://yihui.name/knitr/)\n- We will focus on **`knitr`** in these R Workshops.\n- NO MORE CUT AND PASTE EVER [Video](https://t.co/O8ehDNY7T0)\n\n## Version Control and Collaboration\n\n- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)\n- [Github](https://github.com/)\n- Track all versions - changes and updates\n- Easy to \"roll back\" \n- Easy to collaborate with multiple team members\n- Crowdsourcing & SPEED [\"Open-Source Genomic Analysis of Shiga-Toxin–Producing E. coli O104:H4\"](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1107643?viewType=Print&)\n\n> \"We released these data into the public domain under a Creative Commons 0 license, which elicited a burst of crowd-sourced, curiosity-driven analyses carried out by bioinformaticians on four continents. Twenty-four hours after the release of the genome, it had been assembled; 2 days after its dissemination, it had been assigned to an existing sequence type. Five days after the release of the sequence data, we had designed and released strain-specific diagnostic primer sequences, and within a week, two dozen reports had been filed on an open-source wiki (a Web site that facilitates collaborative effort) dedicated to analysis of the strain.\"\n\n- the [Github Wiki](https://github.com/ehec-outbreak-crowdsourced/BGI-data-analysis/wiki) listed above\n\n\n## Example R Code with Output\n\n```{r cars, echo = TRUE}\nsummary(cars)\n```\n\n## R code with Output Plot\n\n```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}\nplot(pressure)\n```\n\n",
