## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## create some data and look at it

```{r echo=FALSE}
x <- seq(1,10,0.1)
y <- sin(x)
numx <- length(x)
```

We have created a vector of data x and also create y as the sin(x). The length of these 2 vectors is `r numx`.

## plot of x and y

```{r fig.cap="My First Figure"}
plot(x,y)
```

## plot only from begin [`r params$begin`] to end [`r params$end`]

```{r}
a <- params$begin
b <- params$end
plot(x[a:b],y[a:b])
```
