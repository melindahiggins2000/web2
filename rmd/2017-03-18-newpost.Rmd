Here is a short example intro to `ggplot2`.

## based on KnitPost

<p> see <a href="http://jfisher-usgs.github.io/r/2012/07/03/knitr-jekyll/"> http://jfisher-usgs.github.io/r/2012/07/03/knitr-jekyll/ </a></p>

The [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) package provides an easy way to embed 
[R](http://www.r-project.org/) code in a [Jekyll-Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) 
blog post. The only required input is an **R Markdown** source file. 
The name of the source file used to generate this post is *2012-07-03-knitr-jekyll.Rmd*, available
[here](https://github.com/jfisher-usgs/jfisher-usgs.github.com/blob/master/Rmd/2012-07-03-knitr-jekyll.Rmd).
Steps taken to build this post are as follows:

### Step 1

Create a Jekyll-Boostrap blog if you don't already have one. 
A brief tutorial on building this blog is available 
[here](/lessons/2012/05/30/jekyll-build-on-windows/).

### Step 2

Open the R Console and process the source file:

```
KnitPost <- function(input, base.url = "/") {
  require(knitr)
  opts_knit$set(base.url = base.url)
  fig.path <- paste0("figs/", sub(".Rmd$", "", basename(input)), "/")
  opts_chunk$set(fig.path = fig.path)
  opts_chunk$set(fig.cap = "center")
  render_jekyll()
  knit(input, envir = parent.frame())
}
KnitPost("2012-07-03-knitr-jekyll.Rmd")
```

### Step 3

Move the resulting image folder *2012-07-03-knitr-jekyll* and **Markdown** file 
*2012-07-03-knitr-jekyll.md* to the local 
*jfisher-usgs.github.com* [git](http://git-scm.com/) repository.
The KnitPost function assumes that the image folder will be placed in a 
[figs](https://github.com/jfisher-usgs/jfisher-usgs.github.com/tree/master/figs) 
folder located at the root of the repository.

### Step 4

Add the following CSS code to the 
*/assets/themes/twitter-2.0/css/bootstrap.min.css* file to center images:

    [alt=center] {
      display: block;
      margin: auto;
    }

Thats it.

***

Here are a few examples of embedding R code:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

```{r}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.1, 0.1), omi = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(cars)
```

##### Figure 1-1: Caption

```{r}
par(mar = c(2.5, 2.5, 0.5, 0.1), omi = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
filled.contour(volcano)
```

##### Figure 2-1: Caption

And dont forget your session information for proper reproducible research.

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
