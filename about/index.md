## About 

#### I'm a Biostatistician and Chemometrician - both of which represent my passion and focus applying statistics, multivariate pattern recognition, modeling and programming for wide and diverse research areas. I love learning new analysis methods and approaches and writing the code to make it happen. My latest endeavors include using reproducible research and dynamic document procedures to make my data analyses streamlined, easy to execute and well annotated.

## Current

I am currently a senior biostatistician and associate research professor in the [Office of Nursing Research](http://www.nursing.emory.edu/faculty-and-research/onr/index.html) at [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu/) in the [Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing](http://www.nursing.emory.edu/). I primarily collaborate with our [Nursing researchers](http://www.nursing.emory.edu/faculty-and-research/index.html) on their clinical trials, but also support research in the School of Medicine and at [Yerkes National Primate Research Center](http://www.yerkes.emory.edu/). 

I most often use multilevel mixed linear and generalized linear models for longitudinal data analyses - usually comparing a treatment to usual care groups focusing on "group-by-time" interaction effects. However, I have also recently employed instrument response theory and factor analysis exploring latent variable structure for disease knowledge tests and symptom assessment. I have also begun exploring network graph theory and visualization techniques for visualizing multivariate associations and correlation structure among social, psychological, behavioral measures as well as biomarkers and "-omics" outcomes.

## My Background, Experience and Interests

#### My early years

Since my earliest years in grade school and high school I have always been passionate about science and math. In high school I was mentored by an excellent Chemistry teacher who was a PhD research chemist with expertise in organic chemistry. It was in high school that I first worked with scientists at the Fernbank Science Center and at Georgia Tech. They helped me with my science fair projects where I first used gas chromatography and did my first initial data analyses for modeling chemical composition. I also began learning about computers and programming. I learned how to work with a TRS-80 (aka "trash-80") and began running computer programs in BASIC via punch cards using a handset modem.

#### College

After high school, I attended Saint Andrews Presbyterian College (now [Saint Andrews University](http://www.sa.edu/)) from 1985-1989. While in college I double majored in math and chemistry. My math classes covered Calculus, differential equations, and statistics. In chemistry, I took many classes covering analytical chemistry, organic chemistry, natural product synthesis, physical chemistry, quantum mechanics and physics. I was also fortunate to work with many instruments including: gas and liquid chromatography, NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance), IR spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, bomb calorimetry, pH meters, melting point (Mel-Temp) as well as glassware configurations for distillation and other chemical synthesis.
