year = {2016},
abstract = {To determine whether 24\% sucrose solution given orally before insertion of a peripheral intravenous (PIV) catheter decreases neonatal pain.Prior studies of pain caused by heel and arterial needlesticks found oral administration of 24\% sucrose to significantly blunt pain during these painful procedures. No studies have evaluated this treatment with needlestick pain associated with PIV catheter insertion.Oral 24\% sucrose or placebo solution was administered 2 minutes prior to PIV catheter insertion. Outcome measures were obtained prior to, during, and for 5 minutes after PIV catheter insertion. Investigators and caregivers were blinded to group assignment. Data were analyzed with longitudinal analysis of repeated measures, with P < .05 for significance.A total of 40 neonates (24\% sucrose: N = 20; placebo: N = 20) were studied. Pain scores significantly increased from 3.2 ± 1.6 to a maximum of 7.6 ± 3.8 at the time of catheter insertion, returning to baseline levels 8 minutes after PIV catheter insertion (P < .001). No significant differences were found in pain, heart rate, or noninvasive oxygen saturation (SpO2) between the sucrose and placebo groups (P > 0.05).Results from this study did not find that 24\% sucrose administered prior to PIV catheter insertion altered the infant's pain response.Since this is the first study to evaluate the pain-blunting effects of 24\% sucrose administration before PIV catheter insertion, replication of this study is needed before widespread application of findings.},

year = {2015},
abstract = {© 2016 Elsevier Inc.Background: The global Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic of 2014/2015 prompted faculty at Emory University to develop an educational program for nursing students to increase EVD knowledge and confidence and decrease concerns about exposure risk. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of the EVD Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT) educational program. Methods: Informational sessions, online course links, and a targeted, self-directed slide presentation were developed and implemented for the EVD educational program. Three student surveys administered at different time points were used to evaluate the program and change in students' EVD knowledge, confidence in knowledge, and risk concern. Discussion: Implementation of a JiTT educational program effectively achieved our goals to increase EVD knowledge, decrease fear, and enhance student confidence in the ability to discuss EVD risk. These achievements were sustained over time. Conclusion: JiTT methodology is an effective strategy for schools of nursing to respond quickly and comprehensively during an unanticipated infectious disease outbreak.},

year = {2015},
abstract = {© 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.BACKGROUND:: Insomnia is a prevalent sleep disorder, and it has been increasingly associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The reasons for this relationship are not completely understood but may involve endothelial dysfunction. In this study, we hypothesized that insomnia symptoms would be associated with reduced endothelial function. METHODS:: Working adults (n = 496, 67.5\% female, 78.6\% white, mean age 48.7 [SD, 10.8] years, body mass index 28.2 [SD, 6.7] kg/m, diabetes 5.8\%, hypertension 20.0\%, hyperlipidemia 17.9\%, heart disease 2.6\%) enrolled in the Emory-Georgia Tech Predictive Health Institute study completed baseline demographic, clinical, depression (Beck Depression Inventory II), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder 7), sleep (Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index), and noninvasive endothelial function (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation [FMD]) measures. Insomnia symptoms were defined as subjective sleep latency of 30 minutes or longer, nighttime or early morning awakenings, and/or sleep medication use occurring 3 times or more per week in the past month. RESULTS:: Insomnia symptoms were reported by 39.5\% of participants. Multivariable regression models showed that insomnia symptoms, age, baseline artery diameter, and dyslipidemia were inversely related to FMD. After adjusting for age, baseline artery diameter, and dyslipidemia, participants reporting insomnia symptoms had lower FMD than did participants reporting better sleep (adjusted FMD mean, 6.13\% [SD, 0.28\%] vs 6.83\% [SD, 0.26\%], P = .035). CONCLUSION:: In this study, insomnia symptoms were associated with reduced FMD. Research examining the therapeutic benefits of treating insomnia on endothelial function and future cardiovascular risk is warranted.},

abstract = {Copyright © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.Objective: To explore biopsychosocial factors (beliefs, depression, catastrophizing cytokines) in individuals newly diagnosed with lung cancer and no pain to determine their relationship at diagnosis and across time and to determine whether these factors contribute to pain intensity or pain interference with function at pain onset. Materials and Methods: A longitudinal, exploratory, pilot study was implemented in a private medical center and a VA medical center in the southeast. Twelve subjects not experiencing pain related to cancer of the lung or its treatment were recruited. A Karnofsky status of 40\% and hemoglobin of 8 g were required. Five questionnaires were completed and 10mL of blood was drawn at baseline; 4 questionnaires and blood draws were repeated monthly for 5 months. One baseline questionnaire and a pain assessment were added at final. Demographic, clinical, and questionnaire data were summarized; standardized scale scores were calculated. Results: Biopsychosocial scores that were low at baseline increased from T1-T4 but decreased slightly T5-T6. Individuals with higher pain intensity and higher pain interference at final had higher psychosocial scores at baseline than individuals with lower pain intensity and lower pain interference at final. Conclusions: Unrelated to disease stage, metastasis, or treatment, unique levels of biopsychosocial factors are observed in patients newly diagnosed with lung cancer who report higher levels of pain intensity and higher levels of pain interference at the time pain occurs. Replication studies are needed to validate this response pattern and determine the value of repeated individual assessments.},

volume = {62},
year = {2014},
abstract = {Studies show 30\% to 47\% of people with heart failure (HF) have concomitant diabetes mellitus (DM). Self-care for persons with both of these chronic conditions is conflicting, complex, and often inadequate. This pilot study tested an integrated self-care program for its effects on HF and DM knowledge, self-care efficacy, self-care behaviors, and quality of life (QOL). Hospitalized HF-DM participants (N = 71) were randomized to usual care or intervention using a 1:2 allocation and followed at 30 and 90days after intervention. Intervention was an integrated education and counseling program focused on HF-DM self-care. Variables included demographic and clinical data, knowledge about HF and DM, HF- and DM-specific self-efficacy, standard HF and DM QOL scales, and HF and DM self-care behaviors. Analysis included descriptive statistics, multilevel longitudinal models for group and time effects, post hoc testing, and effect size calculations. Sidak adjustments were used to control for type 1 error inflation. The integrated HF-DM self-care intervention conferred effects on improved HF knowledge (30days, p = .05), HF self-care maintenance (30 and 90days, p < .001), HF self-care management (90days, p = .05), DM self-efficacy (30days, p = .03; 90days, p = .004), general diet (30days, p = .05), HF physical QOL (p = .04), and emotional QOL scores (p = .05) at 90days within the intervention group. The participants in the usual care group also reported increased total and physical QOL. Greater percentages of participants in the intervention group improved self reported exercise between 0 and 30days (p = .005 and moderate effect size ES = .47) and foot care between 0 and 90days (p = .03, small ES = .36). No group differences or improvements in DM-specific QOL were observed. An integrated HF-DM self-care intervention was effective in improving essential components of self-care and had sustained (90day) effects on selected self-care behaviors. Future studies testing HF-DM integrated self-care interventions in larger samples with longer follow-up and on other outcomes such as hospitalization and clinical markers are warranted. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Caregivers completed a questionnaire prior to study enrollment, at 6 and 12 months postenrollment. Caregivers in all 3 ethnic groups showed more caregiver competence, reduced depression, greater tolerance for care recipients' memory problems, better management of their overall situation, and improved perception of that situation 6 months and 12 months post-enrollment. The study demonstrates that in the sample studied the SCP was as effective in helping ethnically diverse caregivers as it has shown to be with Caucasian caregivers.

title = {Family context influences psychological outcomes of depressive symptoms and emotional quality of life in patients with heart failure},
volume = {29},
year = {2014},
abstract = {Copyright © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.Background: Although family influences in heart failure (HF) care are considered important, little evidence is available regarding relationships between the family context and specific outcomes for patients with HF. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the relationships of patient perceptions of family functioning, autonomy support, and perceived criticism, as well as their family member's (FM) HF knowledge, with patient outcomes of depressive symptoms and HF quality of life (QOL). Methods: Participants (n = 117) with HF were enrolled in a family partnership intervention study. Self-report questionnaires measuring the HF patient's perceptions of family context and the FM's knowledge were analyzed relative to the HF patient's outcomes using correlations and sequential multivariate regression analyses. Only preintervention, baseline data are reported here. Results: Age, ethnicity, Charlson comorbidity index, global family functioning, and FM's HF knowledge accounted for 37.8\% (P < .001) of the variance in the patient's depressive symptoms. An additional moderating effect of ethnicity on the association between global family functioning and patient's depressive symptoms was significant (change R2 = 0.06, P = .001), resulting in a final model that accounted for 43.3\% of depressive symptom variance. Age, ethnicity, global family functioning, and autonomy support accounted for 24.9\% (P < .001) of the variance in emotional HF QOL. An additional moderating effect of ethnicity on the association between global family functioning and patient's emotional HF QOL was significant (change R2 = 0.05, P = .009), resulting in a final model that accounted for 28.9\% of emotional QOL variance. Conclusions: This study underscores the importance of the patient's perspective on family functioning and autonomy support, along with FM's HF knowledge, on HF patient outcomes moderated by ethnicity. Future interventions could target the modifiable patient-family context relationships for improving depressive symptoms and QOL in HF patients. These findings point to the need for greater family assessment to identify those at risk for worse outcomes and to guide family focused interventions.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine was approved for girls aged 9-24 years in 2006 to prevent HPV infection and cervical cancer. The Parental Human Papillomavirus Survey (PHPVS) was framed on theoretical constructs of the health belief model (HBM) and developed to survey parents regarding their HPV knowledge, attitudes, and intent to vaccinate. Methods: We evaluated the psychometric properties of the PHPVS using classical item analysis and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) among a sample of 200 parents/caregivers. Results: The EFA yielded a 4-factor unidimensional model that explained between 62\% and 68\% of the total variance depending on the extraction method used. The estimated Cronbach's alpha for the PHPVS was .96. Conclusions: The PHPVS is a reliable measure of HPV knowledge, attitudes, and intent to vaccinate. © 2013 Springer Publishing Company.},

The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the efficacy of a group intervention using motivational interviewing (MI) to promote adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and use of risk reduction behaviors (RRB) among HIV-infected women in Nigeria. Recruited participants (n=60) were randomly assigned to the motivational group or the health promotion program (HPP) control group. The 6 month follow-up results indicate that, compared to the control group, MI participants reported significantly higher levels of adherence to ART, higher knowledge of HIV, higher use of condoms/protection during sexual encounters and decision-making not to have sex when no protection was available. The MI participants also had fewer mean number of sexual partners. MI in group format shows promise in promoting adherence to ART and use of RRB in HIV-infected Nigerian women.},

title = {Detection of illegal cannabis cultivation using remote sensing},
year = {2006},
abstract = {Detection of illegal Cannabis cultivation by law enforcement agencies currently relies on low flying aircraft manned by trained aerial spotters. This is physically tiring for the aircrew, inefficient for large or complex landscapes, and is often foiled by camouflaged grow sites. A solution for detecting illegal Cannabis cultivation using remote sensing would be of considerable assistance and may increase the probability of detection. If multiple plants are grown in large homogeneous plots and the location of at least one cultivation site is known, then detection can be considered a traditional spectral land cover/land use classification problem. Probability of success is principally dependent upon the degree to which the known grow site is representative of unknown sites, and the adequacy of the sensor system spatial resolution. However, most illegal cultivation sites in the U.S. are "distributed" with a few isolated plants interspersed with other plant species. For distributed cultivations, requirements for high spatial resolution imagery become paramount and an alternative signature approach may be warranted. Analysis of Cannabis diffuse, nadir spectral signatures using laboratory, field and airborne data show a lack of stable, unique absorption features to use as a universal reference signature. However, Cannabis leaves appear to have a specular reflectance feature that contributes to the "emerald green" appearance reported by aerial spotters. This specular signature may be worthy of exploitation for detection. The leaf shape and plant architecture of Cannabis also offer potential spatial signatures that can be quantified using image texture analysis. These spatial signatures also warrant further investigation.},

abstract = {Stigma has become a gendered phenomenon that affects increasing numbers of HIV-infected women worldwide. This study examined the role of age as a possible moderator of the relationship between stigma and antiretroviral therapy adherence, CD4\% and viral load among 120 HIV-infected women. A secondary analysis was conducted using data from the Keeping Healthy and Active with Risk Reduction and Medication Adherence (KHARMA) Project, an National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded randomized controlled trial to improve Antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence and reduce risky behaviors in HIV-infected women at five clinical sites in a South-eastern city from 2005 to 2008. Stigma was measured using the Perceived Personal Stigma of Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) scale. Among participants <50 years old (n=90), age was significantly associated with viral load (rho=-.24, p=.02) and stigma was negatively associated with CD4\% (r =-.26, p=.02). For the 30 participants >50 years old, age was not significantly associated with viral load, stigma or CD4\%, and there was no significant association between stigma and CD4\% (r=.07, p=.70). These findings indicate the need for further study regarding this potential moderating effect and possible interventions to address the susceptibility of younger women to the harmful effects of stigma.},
