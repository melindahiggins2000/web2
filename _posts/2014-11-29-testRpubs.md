[Rpubs](http://rpubs.com) is a great place to post markdown files created using [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com) and `knitr` to create markdown files that are then rendered and posted at Rpubs. This post describes one of my first posts at Rpubs.

## Install R and RStudio and Rtools

1. Install R from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/)
2. It is also helpful to download [RTools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
3. Install [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) which is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with a helpful GUI (graphical user interface) layout for your R command line, scripting,  logs, output, help and other useful windows all from the same integrated interface.

### RStudio Interface - screen capture running in Windows 8.1
