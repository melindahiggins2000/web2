My initial website was created at [github.com](http://github.com) as a user page with the default `username.github.io` at [melinda.higgins2000.github.io](http://melindahiggins2000.github.io) as a [master branch](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/). However, I redesigned the site as a project page called `web2` located at [melindahiggins2000.github.io/web2/](http://melindahiggins2000.github.io/web2/) under the `gh-pages` branch. I also created another Project Site on [SAS University](http://melindahiggins2000.github.io/sasuniv2).

## First, I created an account at Github

Be sure to create a username you like since this will be your base name for all of your repositories and websites created here.

## Next, finalize your profile and create your first repository

You can customize your profile with your picture and links to your home webpage, email contact info and so so. Once you've got that set-up, go ahead and create a repository and push your content to the site. There are numerous websites on how to do this, including the [Github resources for learning Git and Github](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/).
